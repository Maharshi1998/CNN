This repository contains code for performing image classification tasks using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) implemented with TensorFlow and PyTorch. It also includes pre-trained models for transfer learning.

Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide a collection of CNN models implemented in both TensorFlow and PyTorch for image classification tasks. Additionally, pre-trained models are included for transfer learning, allowing users to fine-tune the models on their own datasets.

Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
PyTorch
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization)
